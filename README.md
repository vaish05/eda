# Exploratory Data Analysis

## GDP vs Life Expectancy

### Research Question: Can the increase in life expectancy since World War 2 be largely explained by increases in GDP per capita?

Explore the relationship between life expectancy and to GDP per capita. Have used R package called gapminder that contains a data set of the same name giving the GDP per capita (adjusted for inflation) and life expectancy in 142 countries for a selection of years from 1952 to 2007. 

## Obama To Trump:

### Research Question: To what extent do attitudes toward immigration explain the switching of votes of 2012 Obama supporters who became 2016 Trump supporters?
Polls have shown that people from certain demographic groups were more likely to switch their votes than others. But what might explain why some people within a group switched, while others didn't? One theory is that attitudes toward immigration became especially salient during the 2016 campaign. 

Have explored the data and then fit a big and complicated logistic regression model. We can't prove cause-and-effect from survey data, but got a sense of whether attitudes toward immigration had explanatory power over and above demographic shifts. Have used the 2016 Cooperative Congressional Election Study, a very large survey of a nationally representative sample of 64,600 adults - http://cces.gov.harvard.edu/data.

## In-Patient Prospective Medical System:

### Research Question - Does increase in the discharge count increase the Average Medicare Payment Amount when categorized by disease group?

Medicare is the federal health insurance program for:

• People who are 65 or older

• Certain younger people with disabilities

• People with End-Stage Renal Disease (permanent kidney failure requiring dialysis or a transplant, called ESRD)

The Trump presidency is looking to curb the funds for certain group of people whom they claim are physically capable of earning an income above the federal poverty line. Focus on performing data analysis on the Provider Utilization and Payment Data Inpatient Public Use File (referred to as “Inpatient PUF”) prepared by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). It contains hospital-specific charges for more than 3,000 U.S. hospitals. The hospitals receive Medicare based on a rate per discharge categorized by the Medicare Severity Diagnosis Related Group (MS-DRG). The Inpatient PUF is available for the years 2011 through 2015. The MS-DRG is limited to the top 100 most frequently billed discharges.
